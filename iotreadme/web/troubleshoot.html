<h3>Ways to troubleshoot MCD if not working:</h3>
<a href="#Server">=> Check if the server and systems are up</a><br>
<a href="#Workorder">=> Check if there is a valid work order</a><br>
<a href="#Routers">=> Check if routers are running</a><br>
<a href="#Pullout">=> Pull out MCD and troubleshoot in Design</a><br>

<h4><span id="Server">1. Check if the server and systems are up</span></h4>
<div style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">

    <p>MCDs sends HTTP request every 30 seconds. Therefore the joborder system
    must be running at all times at work hours. All company's web applications
    are hosted at server IP of 192.168.1.150<p>

    <p>First, ping the server. If packets were sent and received at 100%, the
    server machine is turned on and wired to the network. If the ping has no
    or unstable response, the server might be going under maintenance.</p>

    <p>Check the /joborder/ system if its responsive. Type `192.168.1.150:8080/joborder`
        into the browser. Login with username: `rjordan` and password: `jordan123`.</p>

    <p>If the grids of the job order or work order are slowly loading the list,
        the system is not responsive and should be refreshed or restarted if it does
        not return to normal.</p>

<h4><span id="Workorder">2. Check if there is a valid work order</span></h4>
<div style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">

    See if there is a work order running on that machine. Get the MCD Id of the<br>
    machine from machines.xlsx file. Take for example 10007:
    <br><br>

    <img src="machines.png">
    <br><br>

    Open Postman and query test to see if there is work order running:<br><br>
    Method: POST<br>
    URL: http://192.168.1.150:8080/joborder/IoTWorkInfo<br>
    Parameters:<br>
    &emsp;mId: 10007<br>
    &emsp;timestamp: 1631887744<br>
    &emsp;a: t8WooU5D1anfJhdoK4LjhRGT5XD2sbp28M1s72K9vizot9NmGn80s6nNsmsYoiJ<br>
    &emsp;h: f7bc83f430538424b13298e6aa6fb143ef4d59a14946175997479dbc2d1a3cd8<br><br>

    <br><br>
    “No work in Queue, or already completed” means no work order and machine will<br>
    not run since no electric supply from MCD.<br><br>

    Test query another machine, 100071 for example:<br><br>
    <img src="succ.png">
    <br><br>
    Go to epochconverter.com and paste epoch time (dTime) to see the readable date.<br>
    sTime (start time): 1636706922 = Monday, November 15, 2021 12:54:37 AM<br>
    dTime (deadline time): 1637158722 = Wednesday, November 17, 2021 2:18:42 PM<br><br>
    <img src="epoch.png"><br>
    <img src="lcd_succ.png"><br><br>

    Work order starts at 11-15-2021 12:54:37 AM and ends at 11-17-2021 2:18:42 PM. <br>
    The message tells us that there is work order and the machine should run.<br>

<h4><span id="Routers">3. See if RT-N12+ routers are running</span></h4>
<div style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">
    <p>There are 3 routers in north, 1 in central and 1 in south plant. These routers
        serves as an access point so that MCDs can access the job order system. MCDs
        located in ER connect to ER router, MCDs located in MF connect to MF router,
        MCDs located in Finance connect to Finance router. No router means no MCD working.
        They must be running at all times at work hours. Make sure to tighten the Ethernet
        cable from and to its Ethernet port. </p>
    <p>ER router has an IP of 192.168.1.34. Enter the IP in the browser. If the router’s
        web page renders when typing its IP, the router is ok and running.</p>
    username: admin<br>
    password: WmdcPassword5432<br>
    <img src="er.png"><br>
    <p>MF router has an IP of 192.168.1.3. Enter the IP in the browser. If the router’s
        web page renders when typing its IP, the router is ok and running.</p>
    <img src="mf.png"><br>
    <p>Finance router has an IP of 192.168.1.32. Enter the IP in the browser. If the
        router’s web page renders when typing its IP, the router is ok and running.</p>

<h4><span id="Pullout">4. Pull out MCD and troubleshoot in Design</span></h4>
<div style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">
    <p>If none of the above works, the last step is to eject MCD from the machine,
        bring it to design and troubleshoot</p>
